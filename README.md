# ⚖️ Business Rules

## ⚖️ Business Rules
All write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on core tables are blocked from **Monday to Friday**.  
A validation trigger checks the current weekday and prevents changes.

**System Behavior**
- If a restricted operation is attempted during Mon–Fri, the system cancels the action.
- Raises a custom error:  
  **ORA-20040: FARMERS Table: Operation not allowed on weekdays**  
  (Message differs per table.)

**Purpose**
- Protects data integrity by restricting operations to approved days only.

---

## **Rule 2: No Holiday Operations**
System prevents write operations if the current date is listed in the **HOLIDAYS** table.

**How It Works**
- Trigger checks today's date against the holiday list.
- If it matches → operation is blocked.
- Works together with the weekday rule for double protection.

**Purpose**
- Ensures no system changes occur during official non-working days.

---

## **Rule 3: Automatic Payment Calculation**
The PAYMENTS table is updated automatically based on recorded deliveries.

**Payment Formula**
payment_amount = weight_kg × price_per_kg

**How It Works**
- System retrieves **price_per_kg** from `COFFEE_QUALITY`.
- Trigger inserts the calculated payment into `PAYMENTS`.
- No manual payment entry needed.

**Purpose**
- Prevents errors and guarantees consistent payment computation.

---

## **Rule 4: Anomaly Detection (Weight Deviation Alerts)**
System monitors delivery weights for sudden abnormal deviations.

**Trigger Behavior**
- Every new delivery is compared to the farmer's historical average.
- If deviation exceeds **50%** (configurable per farmer), an entry is added to the `ALERTS` table.

**Purpose**
- Detects unusual activity (fraud, measurement faults, or inconsistencies).
- Provides real-time reporting and audit trail.
